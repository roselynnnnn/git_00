## First Verse 
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Lewis Carrol in this section!-->

Little Birds are diningWarily and well,  
Hid in mossy cell:  
Hid, I say, by waiters. 
Gorgeous in their gaiters -  
I've a Tale to tell.  

## Second Verse
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Robert Frost here!-->

Some say the world will end in fire,  
Some say in ice.  
From what I've tasted of desire  
I hold with those who favor fire.  
But if it had to perish twice,  
I think I know enough of hate  
To say that for destruction ice  
Is also great  
And would suffice.  

## Third Verse
<!--Put the first two verses of The Walrus and the Carpenter here!-->

## Last Verse
<!--Put a short poem of your choice 8-20 lines,here!-->
